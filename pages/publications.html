                                how to
                                program computers
                                which
                                integrates an automatic grading tool. The educational environment offers summative and
                                formative feedback, by evaluating the functionality of computer programs. Given a
                                programming problem, students must write a solution and validate it through the
                                automatic
                                grading tool of the educational environment. Summative feedback is offered through
                                verdicts
                                of the programs, indicating whether the syntax, semantics and efficiency of the program
                                are
                                correct or present some type of error. Based on these verdicts, a grade is assigned to
                                the
                                solutions proposed by the students. Moreover, the environment also offers formative
                                feedback
                                through different mechanisms that support the student in the improvement of the proposed
                                programming solutions, before these solutions are submitted for assessment. These
                                mechanisms
                                include: a code editor with syntax highlighting and automatic autocompletion; automatic
                                verification of good programming practices; interactive visualization of the program
                                execution from its source code; a partial scoring system, which assigns partial credit
                                to
                                incomplete or not entirely correct solutions; a test module with personalized inputs;
                                support for submitting programs with multiple source code files and projects;
                                compatibility
                                for several programming languages ​​including Java, Python, JavaScript and C/C++; a
                                manual
                                assessment module; and interactive statistical reports for students and teachers.</p>

                                The state of the art of tools to support the learning of computer programming is
                                comprised
                                of learning environments and automatic grading systems. The first group includes: basic
                                programming environments, interactive environments based on examples,
                                visualizations/animations, and intelligent tutoring systems. However, generally these
                                systems lack of grading tools, which could be useful to carry out formative evaluation
                                processes while the students practice. On the other hand, in most cases the automatic
                                grading systems focus only on the assessment of the programs (online judges), which are
                                generally adaptations of the evaluation systems used in programming competitions.
                                Although
                                these systems have been shown to be effective in improving the practical skills of
                                students
                                and the competitive aspect has proven to be an excellent motivation for students, these
                                systems fall short as formative assessment tools. This is due to the limited feedback
                                given
                                to the student and their lack of integration with content and tools typical from
                                learning
                                environments.

                                This article describes the use of an automatic tool that supports both formative and
                                summative evaluation, in an introductory computer programming course. The aim was to
                                test
                                the tool in a real scenario and to assess its potential benefits. The participants were

                                students in an engineering school. Different programming tasks were solved by students
                                with
                                the support of the tool. It provides summative evaluation using automatic grading, and
                                formative evaluation through real-time checking of good coding practices, code execution
                                visualisation, testing code with custom inputs, informative feedback on failed test
                                cases,
                                and student performance statistics for self-monitoring the learning process. Results of
                                the
                                experience show the students considerably used the tool, denoting high engagement to
                                achieve
                                the learning goals of the tasks. The students perceived the tool was highly useful to
                                debug
                                programs and carry out frequent practice of programming, thanks to the automatic
                                feedback
                                and test of solutions for programming assignments. Results offer evidence of the
                                importance
                                of providing comprehensive feedback to facilitate students finding mistakes and building
                                knowledge about how to proceed in case of errors. Moreover, the tool shows some
                                potential to
                                help students developing learning strategies, e.g. metacognitive awareness and improving
                                problem-solving skills.

                            <p class="text-justify">Jupyter notebooks provide an interactive programming environment 
                                that allows writing code, text, equations, and multimedia resources. They are widely 
                                used as a teaching support tool in computer science and engineering courses. However, 
                                manual grading programming assignments in Jupyter notebooks is a challenging task, 
                                thus using an automatic grader becomes a must. This paper presents UNCode notebook 
                                auto-grader, that offers summative and formative feedback instantaneously. It provides 
                                instructors with an easy-to-use grader generator within the platform, without having 
                                to deploy a new server. Additionally, we report the experience of employing this tool
                                in two artificial intelligence courses: Introduction to Intelligent Systems and
                                Machine Learning. Several programming activities were carried out using the 
                                proposed tool. Analysis of students’ interactions with the tool and the students’ 
                                perceptions are presented. Results showed that the tool was widely used 
                                to evaluate their tasks, as a large number of submissions were performed. Students 
                                expressed positive opinions mostly, giving feedback about the auto-grader, highlighting 
                                the usefulness of the immediate feedback and the grading code, among other aspects 
                                that helped them to solve the activities. Results remarked on the importance of 
                                providing clear grading code and formative feedback to help the students to identify 
                                errors and correct them.

                            <p class="text-justify">In recent years, learning analytics has emerged as one of the most important fields on the future of education. 
                                In the context of programming courses, the applications of learning analytics show high efficacy in giving directions for interventions, 
                                which help to promote better learning methods. However, few investigations have considered complex datasets where there are heterogeneous student's groups, 
                                letting out differential factors that can influence in the learning process. The main objective of this
                                work is determining the relations between the measurements and metrics of the learning process with
                                the academic performance of the computer programming students of the National University of Colombia. 
                                We apply a quantitative non-experimental methodological design, using as source of information
                                the records of 2 years of student's interactions with an educational platform of automatic grading and
                                feedback use in the course. In total 38 variables are considered in this work, that include the number
                                of submissions, the results of each submission, software metrics, and the use rates of the tools available in the platform. 
                                The results show that the number of submissions, three types of results/verdicts,
                                two verdict's rates, and one software metric have a positive correlation with the academic performance.
                                Moreover, the runtime error rate, and the use of a good practices verification tool (i.e., Linter) have a
                                negative correlation with the final performance of the students.</p>

                                format (Jupyter notebooks), an automatic assessment tool (UNCode), and an education-oriented forum platform
                                (Piazza). The study included 100 students from three different sections of the Introduction to Computer Programming
                                course at an engineering school. The study analysed both the use of the tools and the students’ perception of them.
                                Usage was evaluated quantitatively using usage statistics reported by the forum and automatic evaluation tools. Student
                                perception was assessed using a survey with closed-ended and open-ended questions. The results of the study show that
                                all three tools had a positive impact on the students’ learning experience. In general, the participants found Jupyter
                                notebooks, UNCode and Piazza forums easy to use, and useful to better understand the programming problems to be solved.

                                This article proposes a framework based on a sequential explanatory mixed-methods design in the learning analytics domain to enhance the models 
                                used to support the success of the learning process and the learner. The framework consists of three main phases: (1) quantitative data analysis; 
                                (2) qualitative data analysis; and (3) integration and discussion of results. Furthermore, we illustrated the application of this framework by 
                                examining the relationships between learning process metrics and academic performance in the subject of Computer Programming coupled with content 
                                analysis of the responses to a students’ perception questionnaire of their learning experiences in this subject.

                            Automated grading software tool with feedback process to support learning of hardware description languages.

                                Hardware Description Languages (HDL) have gained popularity in the field of digital electronics design, driven by the increasing complexity 
                                of modern electronic circuits. Consequently, supporting students in their learning of these languages is crucial. This work aims to address 
                                this need by developing an automated assessment software tool with feedback process to support the learning of HDL and making an educational 
                                intervention to support the learning process of students. The tool’s features were selected based on similar developments, and a prototype was 
                                designed and implemented. Additionally, an educational intervention was conducted over a five-week period in a Digital Electronics course at the 
                                National University of Colombia. Through analyzing students’ interactions with the tool and their perceptions of its usage, the study examined 
                                their learning experiences. Among the features highlighted by students as most beneficial for their HDL learning process were the online availability 
                                of the tool, the feedback system that helped them identify and correct errors in their code, the provision of immediate feedback, the online editor 
                                with syntax highlighting, and the graphical user interface. This work makes two significant contributions to the field of HDL teaching in engineering. 
                                Firstly, a publicly accessible HDL grading tool has been developed, offering students immediate formative and summative feedback through an automated grader. 
                                Secondly, empirical evidence has been provided regarding the benefits of using such a tool in enhancing students’ learning process.
