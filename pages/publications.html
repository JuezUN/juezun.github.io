                            <p class="text-justify">Jupyter notebooks provide an interactive programming environment 
                                that allows writing code, text, equations, and multimedia resources. They are widely 
                                used as a teaching support tool in computer science and engineering courses. However, 
                                manual grading programming assignments in Jupyter notebooks is a challenging task, 
                                thus using an automatic grader becomes a must. This paper presents UNCode notebook 
                                auto-grader, that offers summative and formative feedback instantaneously. It provides 
                                instructors with an easy-to-use grader generator within the platform, without having 
                                to deploy a new server. Additionally, we report the experience of employing this tool
                                in two artificial intelligence courses: Introduction to Intelligent Systems and
                                Machine Learning. Several programming activities were carried out using the 
                                proposed tool. Analysis of students’ interactions with the tool and the students’ 
                                perceptions are presented. Results showed that the tool was widely used 
                                to evaluate their tasks, as a large number of submissions were performed. Students 
                                expressed positive opinions mostly, giving feedback about the auto-grader, highlighting 
                                the usefulness of the immediate feedback and the grading code, among other aspects 
                                that helped them to solve the activities. Results remarked on the importance of 
                                providing clear grading code and formative feedback to help the students to identify 
                                errors and correct them.

                                integrates an automatic grading tool. The educational environment offers summative and
                                formative feedback, by evaluating the functionality of computer programs. Given a
                                programming problem, students must write a solution and validate it through the
                                automatic
                                grading tool of the educational environment. Summative feedback is offered through
                                verdicts
                                of the programs, indicating whether the syntax, semantics and efficiency of the program
                                are
                                correct or present some type of error. Based on these verdicts, a grade is assigned to
                                the
                                solutions proposed by the students. Moreover, the environment also offers formative

                                through different mechanisms that support the student in the improvement of the proposed
                                programming solutions, before these solutions are submitted for assessment. These
                                mechanisms
                                include: a code editor with syntax highlighting and automatic autocompletion; automatic
                                verification of good programming practices; interactive visualization of the program
                                execution from its source code; a partial scoring system, which assigns partial credit
                                to
                                incomplete or not entirely correct solutions; a test module with personalized inputs;
                                support for submitting programs with multiple source code files and projects;
                                compatibility
                                for several programming languages ​​including Java, Python, JavaScript and C/C++; a

                                The state of the art of tools to support the learning of computer programming is
                                comprised
                                of learning environments and automatic grading systems. The first group includes: basic
                                programming environments, interactive environments based on examples,
                                visualizations/animations, and intelligent tutoring systems. However, generally these
                                systems lack of grading tools, which could be useful to carry out formative evaluation
                                processes while the students practice. On the other hand, in most cases the automatic
                                grading systems focus only on the assessment of the programs (online judges), which are
                                generally adaptations of the evaluation systems used in programming competitions.
                                Although
                                these systems have been shown to be effective in improving the practical skills of
                                students
                                and the competitive aspect has proven to be an excellent motivation for students, these
                                systems fall short as formative assessment tools. This is due to the limited feedback
                                given
                                to the student and their lack of integration with content and tools typical from
                                learning
                                environments.

                                programming
                                course supported by an automatic assessment tool, applied to the practical programming
                                exercises performed by the students. The interaction between the students and the
                                assessment
                                tool was studied through quantitative analyses. In particular, the solutions proposed by
                                the
                                students (computer programs) were analyzed using the verdicts given by the automatic
                                assessment tool: correct solutions or incorrect solutions. In the case of incorrect
                                solutions, the types of programming errors were studied. Additionally, interaction was
                                also
                                studied by analyzing the students’ success rate. This rate is the percentage of correct
                                solutions among the total number of attempts (correct and incorrect). Moreover, the
                                relationship between success rate and academic performance was analyzed. Furthermore,
                                this
                                research examines the students’ perceptions toward the assessment tool through
                                interviews.
                                The results of this study help understanding the benefits and perceptions of the
                                students
                                with respect to the use of an automatic assessment tool in a computer programming
                                course.</p>

                                This article describes the use of an automatic tool that supports both formative and
                                summative evaluation, in an introductory computer programming course. The aim was to
                                test
                                the tool in a real scenario and to assess its potential benefits. The participants were
                                56
                                students in an engineering school. Different programming tasks were solved by students
                                with
                                the support of the tool. It provides summative evaluation using automatic grading, and
                                formative evaluation through real-time checking of good coding practices, code execution
                                visualisation, testing code with custom inputs, informative feedback on failed test
                                cases,
                                and student performance statistics for self-monitoring the learning process. Results of
                                the
                                experience show the students considerably used the tool, denoting high engagement to
                                achieve
                                the learning goals of the tasks. The students perceived the tool was highly useful to
                                debug
                                programs and carry out frequent practice of programming, thanks to the automatic
                                feedback
                                and test of solutions for programming assignments. Results offer evidence of the
                                importance
                                of providing comprehensive feedback to facilitate students finding mistakes and building
                                knowledge about how to proceed in case of errors. Moreover, the tool shows some
                                potential to
                                help students developing learning strategies, e.g. metacognitive awareness and improving
                                problem-solving skills.
